                                First, thank you very much for coming to my Official Account.<br>

                                I'm a self-taught Graphic designer. 5 years ago, I started my freelance graphic designing journey. From 2017 until now, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have been involved in learning about this field as a hobby. I have even achieved international success in my journey which started at a young age.
